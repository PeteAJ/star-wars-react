# React Hooks in Practice ðŸ‘‹

---

## My "go-to" hooks

- useReducer
- useState
- useEffect
- useCallback
- useMemo

---

## Demo App

- Inspired by interview scenarios
- Candidates are asked to build something
- Usually: with an API.

---

## Features

- show a list of people and films
- select a person and see what films they were in
- text search? (why not)

---

## Bootstrapping

* We start with the `useReducer` hook
* We establish the initial state of the app
* Alternatively `useState` to decentralize app state

---

<CodeSurferColumns themes={[vsDark, github]}>

<Step>

```js
const initialState = {};
```

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

```js
const initialState = {
  movieData: {
    characters: [],
    films: []
  },
  searchText: null,
  selectedCharacter: null
};
```

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case Actions.SET_MOVIE_DATA:
      return { ...state, movieData: action.payload, status: ApiStatus.loaded };
    case Actions.TOGGLE_VIEW_CHARACTER:
      return { ...state, selectedCharacter: action.payload };
    case Actions.SEARCH:
      return { ...state, searchText: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useReducer: Example"
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```
</CodeSurfer>

---

## useReducer
- `Action` by convention is: `{ type: string; payload?: any; }`
- accepts a reducer of type `State -> Action -> State`
- `useReducer` returns a pair of `[State, Dispatch]`
- where dispatch is `Action -> IO`

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useState: Example"
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
// somewhere else in your code
setState(newState);
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## useState

- during initial render returned `State` is the same as the argument
- signature: `State -> [State, State -> IO]`
- `setState` will trigger a re-render

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useEffect: Example"
function MyComponent(props) {
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () => {
    // Clean up the subscription
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [source]);
 // ... continued
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Doing Real Stuff

- now we can kick off the side effects we need
- getting to know our friend `useEffect`

---

## useEffect

- accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code
- accepts an array of dependencies that will trigger the effect to run again
- can return a cleanup handler that will be invoked before re-invoking the function

---

## useEffect: In Practice

- similar to `cDM` in class components
- good place for api calls
- good place to do effectful things after component is mounted
- much more versatile than L/C methods

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useEffect: Demo App"
useEffect(() => {
    // conditionally perform side-effect
    if (status !== ApiStatus.loaded) {
      loadApi(tmdbApiKey).then(action => dispatch(action));
    }
}, [tmdbApiKey, status]); // note the props
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useCallback: Example"
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
);
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## useCallback

- pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies
- callback is `memoized` until the dependencies change

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useCallback: Demo App"
const renderCard = useCallback((props) => {
  const expanded = key === selected;
  const toggleSelect = () => {
    const value = expanded ? null : key;
    onChange({ value });
  };
  return (<DetailCard {...{...props, toggleSelect, expanded }} />);
}, [onChange, selected]);
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useMemo: example"
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## useMemo

- like `useCallback` but for values (not functions)

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="useMemo: Demo App"
  const imageComponent = useMemo(() =>
    imageUrl ? (
      <img className="photo" src={imageUrl} alt={subtitle} />
    ) : (
      <i className="fas fa-id-card-alt missing-photo" />
    ), [imageUrl, subtitle]
  );

  return (<div className="card-image">{imageComponent}</div>);
```

</CodeSurfer>

## Other Hooks: In Practice

- just some guidelines and notes to help familiarize
- don't trust me, trust the API docs

---

## useRef

- can be passed as a prop to `DOM` elements to access `DOM` API
- can be used as a replacement for instance variables in class components


---

## useImperativeHandle

- can be used to expose imperative methods to other components
- works by "forwarding" refs
- client component would use the `ref` prop to access your exposed API

---

## useLayoutEffect

- guaranteed to fire after _all_ `DOM` mutations
- might come in handy


---

## Back to Earth
- we just scratched the surface
- play around with the demo app and possibly extend it
- create your own demo apps!
- write your own hooks (but master the building blocks)
- study other hooks (prior art)

---

---

## Playing Around: Nits

- variable column layout
- ugly
- key mismatch across data ApiStatus

--- 

## Playing Around: Cool

- use [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) 
- Suspense loading
- React-Spring for animations
- Hook up other endpoints

---

## Playing Around: Next-Next Steps?
- Play with GQL
- Convert to static website with GatsbyJS or SSR
